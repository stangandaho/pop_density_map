# Mapping with R
mapr is a R code repository for spatial data visualization using R. This project is dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the capabilities of R in handling, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. It includes code samples with comments, datasets (large dataset such as raster are not included - but the links to access are provided), and various resources aimed at helping users create effective and beautiful maps with R.  

To start using the resources in this repository, clone it:

```
git clone https://github.com/stangandaho/mapr.git
